Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\n",

So, sulfur dioxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, sulfur dioxide is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for krypton contains one symbol: Kr. So, krypton is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, krypton is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for potassium nitrate contains three symbols: K for potassium, N for nitrogen, and O for oxygen. So, potassium nitrate is made of three chemical elements bonded together.

Starting in 1046 BCE, rulers from the Zhou (pronounced JO) dynasty claimed to have something called the Mandate of Heaven. A mandate is the authority to act in a certain way.

       "        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> When a person has a mandate, it means that he or she is allowed to act in a certain way. In ancient China, the Mandate of Heaven meant that a ruler had special authority to rule, and that authority came from heaven.\n",
       "The Mandate of Heaven gave a ruler permission to act in a certain way, so the ruler was not allowed to act however he wanted. The Mandate of Heaven did not force the ruler to pray or make the ruler rich.\n",
