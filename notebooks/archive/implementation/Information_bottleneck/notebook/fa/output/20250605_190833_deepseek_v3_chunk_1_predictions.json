    "explanation": "Subduction involves the movement of one tectonic plate beneath another, which can lead to significant geological activity, including the transfer of large amounts of thermal energy. This process is associated with the melting of materials and the generation of magma, resulting in volcanic activity and the release of heat. In contrast, the other processes listed do not primarily involve significant thermal energy transfer.",

    "explanation": "A galaxy occupies the greatest amount of space as it is a vast collection of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter, often containing billions of stars and spanning tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of light-years across. In contrast, a black hole, neutron star, and solar system are significantly smaller in scale compared to the immense size of a galaxy.",

    "prediction": "D",
    "explanation": "In a stronger gravitational field, an organism would benefit from having short, strong limbs to support its body weight and maintain stability. Longer limbs would be less effective in such an environment, as they would be more prone to bending or breaking under increased gravitational stress. Therefore, short, strong limbs would provide the necessary strength and support for movement and survival.",
