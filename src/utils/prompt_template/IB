===================

You are given a multiple-choice question and an explanation that justifies one of the answer choices.

Your task is to select which answer (A, B, C, or D) is most strongly supported by the explanation — **without access to the passage or question**.

Only use the explanation to infer the correct answer.

Question:
{question}

Options:
A) {option_A}  
B) {option_B}  
C) {option_C}  
D) {option_D}

Explanation:
{explanation}

Based solely on this explanation, which answer option is most likely correct? (Just say A/B/C/D)

===================

You are given a multiple-choice question, its options, the correct answer, and an explanation justifying that answer.

Your task is to decide whether this explanation contains any **unnecessary, redundant, or off-topic information**.  
Unnecessary parts include: repeated phrases, irrelevant facts, or overly long reasoning that is not essential for justifying the answer.

---

Answer only in the following format:

<redundant>Yes</redundant>(Just say Yes or No)  
<justification>[Brief reason why you think it’s redundant or not]</justification>

---

### Example 1 (Concise):

Question:  
Why do people carry umbrellas on cloudy days?

Options:  
A) To shield from wind  
B) Because it's fashionable  
C) In case it rains  
D) To keep warm

Correct Answer: C

Explanation:  
People carry umbrellas on cloudy days in case it rains, as cloudy weather often signals possible rain.

<redundant>No</redundant>  
<justification>The explanation clearly and concisely supports the correct answer without any repetition or irrelevant detail.</justification>

---

### Example 2 (Redundant):

Question:  
Why might someone avoid walking alone at night?

Options:  
A) To save energy  
B) To avoid danger  
C) To get exercise  
D) Because it's bright

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:  
Someone might avoid walking alone at night to stay safe. Walking alone at night is dangerous, and being alone at night can lead to unsafe situations. Safety is important, and being alone at night is not safe.

<redundant>Yes</redundant>(Just say Yes or No)   
<justification>The explanation repeats the same idea (night is unsafe) multiple times without adding new reasoning.</justification>

### Now your turn:

Question:

Evaluate the explanation.

===================

You are given a multiple-choice question, the correct answer, and an initial explanation.

Your task is to improve this explanation in one of two ways:

- If the explanation is missing important reasoning or does not clearly justify the correct answer, revise it to be more complete and logically sound.
- If the explanation contains any redundant, off-topic, or overly verbose content, revise it to be more concise while preserving clarity.

You are an explanation refinement agent.

You will receive a multiple-choice question, its options, the correct answer, and an initial explanation.

Your task is to:
1. Evaluate whether the explanation is **sufficient**: does it clearly justify the correct answer based on the question?
2. Evaluate whether it is **concise**: does it avoid repetition, off-topic content, or unnecessary elaboration?
3. If any issue is found, revise the explanation to make it more sufficient and/or concise.

Repeat the evaluation process after each revision. Stop once the explanation is both sufficient and concise.
