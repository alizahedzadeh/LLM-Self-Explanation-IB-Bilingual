339,2339,Mercury_7100695,,"[Mountain ranges form over millions of years due to tectonic processes, making them the geologic structure that takes the longest time to form compared to faults, sinkholes, or river meanders.]","What is the most likely correct answer to the question about the geologic structure that takes the longest time to form? The question asks which geologic structure will most likely take the longest time to form, with options being a fault, a sinkhole, a river meander, or a mountain range. To determine the answer, we need to consider the typical time scales involved in the formation of these structures. 

Faults are fractures in the Earth's crust where movement has occurred, and they can form relatively quickly during earthquakes. Sinkholes are depressions that form when the ground collapses into voids created by the dissolution of soluble rocks, and they can form over years to decades. River meanders are bends in a river that develop over time due to erosion and deposition, typically taking hundreds to thousands of years to form. Mountain ranges are large-scale landforms created by tectonic forces, such as the collision of continental plates, and their formation can take millions of years. 

Given these time scales, the formation of a mountain range is the most time-consuming process among the options. 

The correct answer is D) a mountain range.
