Passage: Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with one another. Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one-hundred percent certainty. Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic streams tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically. To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity. These relationships help in planning, design, and operations of roadway facilities.

Question: According to the passage, which of the following can be difficult to gauge due to the unpredictability of drivers?

Options:
A) Traffic velocity  
B) Roadway planning  
C) Roadway operations  
D) Traffic Flow

Passage: The protest started around 11:00 local time (UTC+1) on Whitehall opposite the police-guarded entrance to Downing Street, the Prime Minister's official residence. Just after 11:00, protesters blocked traffic on the northbound carriage in Whitehall. At 11:20, the police asked the protesters to move back on to the pavement, stating that they needed to balance the right to protest with the traffic building up. Around 11:29, the protest moved up Whitehall, past Trafalgar Square, along the Strand, passing by Aldwych and up Kingsway towards Holborn where the Conservative Party were holding their Spring Forum in the Grand Connaught Rooms hotel.

Passage: Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine. Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior. Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face. Such things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real life problems. The AI ​​system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as has been built in several home computer and video game software applications.

Question: According to the passage, which of the following is an accurate summary of AI’s main purpose?

Options:
A) Planning  
B) Voice recognition   
C) Scheduling  
D) Task automation

Passage: Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully awakening during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a short time later (10–60 minutes). This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you. If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off. Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking lots of fluid (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate.

Question: After purposefully awakening during the normal sleep period, which of these would interfere with the sleep interruption process?

Options:
A) Reading for an hour and half before falling back to sleep  
B) Using the bathroom and going right back to bed  
C) Shutting off the alarm on your nightstand and falling back to sleep twenty minutes later

Passage: The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material. Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium. They did two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.

Passage: Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th Century. Although wagonways merely consisted of parallel planks of wood, they allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rough roads of the day. Crossties were introduced fairly early to hold the tracks in place. Gradually, however, it was realised that tracks would be more efficient if they had a stip of iron on the top. This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons. Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first full-iron rails were introduced.

Question: According to the passage, why were wooden wheels replaced by iron wheels?

A) The increased the horses speed  
B) They were considered more efficient  
C) They were able to handle larger loads

Passage: The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and number of lens elements required to achieve a range of focal lengths is much greater than for prime lenses. This is becoming less of an issue as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production. This has allowed zoom lenses to produce pictures of a quality comparable to that achieved by lenses with fixed focal length. Another disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is usually lower. This makes inexpensive zoom lenses hard to use in low-light conditions without a flash.

Question: Based on the information in the passage, when might a zoom lens be preferable to a prime lens?

Options:
A) If a high maximum aperture is a priority  
B) If you want less lens elements  
C) If you don’t want to use a flash in darker settings

Passage: While one experimental vaccine appears able to reduce Ebola mortality, up until now, no drugs have been clearly demonstrated suitable for treating existing infection. One antibody cocktail, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but formal studies indicated it had less benefit than sought in preventing death. In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatments to it.

A) The studies showed it may have more benefits than previously thought

Passage: With the change from the quarter to the half mile run, speed becomes of much less importance and endurance becomes an absolute necessity. Of course a first-class half-miler, a man who can beat two minutes, must be possessed of a fair amount of speed, but endurance must be cultivated at all hazards. Some cross country running during the winter, combined with gymnasium work for the upper part of the body, is the best preparation for the running season.

A) Practicing cross country running during the winter months

Passage: Red tide is caused by a higher than normal concentration of Karenia brevis, a naturally-occurring single-celled marine organism. Natural factors can intersect to produce ideal conditions, allowing this algae to increase in number dramatically. The algae produces a neurotoxin that can disable nerves in both humans and fish. Fish often die because of the high concentrations of the toxin in the waters. Humans can be affected by breathing affected water taken into the air by wind and waves.

Passage: Asynchronous communication encourages time for reflection and reaction to others. It allows students the ability to work at their own pace and control the pace of instructional information. In addition, there are fewer time restrictions with the possibility of flexible working hours. (Bremer, 1998) The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to have access to information at all times. Students can also submit questions to instructors at any time of day and expect reasonably quick responses, rather than waiting until the next face-to-face meeting.

Question: Which of the following is not a benefit of asynchronous communication for students?

A) The use of internet as a resource

Passage: Entering Southern Africa by car is an amazing way to see all the region's beauty as well as to get to places off the normal tourist routes. This can be done in a normal car with careful planning but a 4x4 is highly advised and many locations are only accessible with a high wheel base 4x4. Keep in mind while planning that although Southern Africa is stable not all neighboring countries are. Visa requirements and costs vary from nation to nation and are affected by the country you come from. Each country also has unique laws requiring what emergency items need to be in the car.

Question: According to the passage, what would be considered bad advice for tourists looking to explore Southern Africa by car?

Options:
A) Certain in-car emergency items might be required by law  
B) Though a 4x4 is recommended, most locations are accessible with a normal vehicle  
C) Traveling via car is great for those looking to deviate from typical routes
