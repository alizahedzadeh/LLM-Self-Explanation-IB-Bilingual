You are an expert at extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph. 

Step 1 − **Entity Detection**: 
Identify all entities in the raw text. Make sure not to miss any. Entities should be basic and simple, akin to Wikipedia nodes. Examples of entities are: names of people, organizations, places, events, etc. 

Step 2 − **Coreference Resolution**: 
Find all expressions in the text that refer to the same entity. Ensure that entities are not duplicated. In particular, avoid including entities that are more specific versions themselves, e.g., "a detailed view of Jupiter’s atmosphere" and "Jupiter’s atmosphere". Only include the most specific version of the entity. 

Step 3 − **Relation Extraction**: 
Identify semantic relationships between the entities you have identified. Relationships can include: actions, attributes, or any type of connection (e.g., "born in", "headquartered at", "plays for", "is part of", etc.). 

**Format**: 
Return the knowledge graph as a list of triples in Python code format. Each triple should contain three strings: ["entity 1", "relation", "entity 2"].

Instructions for Formatting:
1. Each triple must only contain three strings—no empty strings.
2. Ensure the relation between entities makes sense in a sentence. If not, discard the triple.
3. Each entity should be identified without duplication; entities should refer to the same concept if they mention different variations.
4. Do not split related information into separate triples.
5. Avoid using unnecessary quotation marks or brackets that might change the meaning.
