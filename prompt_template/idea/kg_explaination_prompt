You are an expert in **structured information extraction** for building **faithful and compact knowledge graphs** to support **explanation evaluation** in question answering.

You are given an **explanation text** that justifies why a certain answer to a question is correct.  
You must carefully extract a **knowledge graph** that captures the **key reasoning steps** and **facts** mentioned in the explanation.

Follow these steps carefully:

---

### Step 1 − **Entity Extraction**  
Identify and extract all **key entities** mentioned in the explanation.  
- Entities should be **atomic, distinct, and Wikipedia-like concepts** (e.g., people, locations, objects, events, causes, properties).  
- Focus on entities that are **critical to the reasoning or justification** provided.  
- If multiple phrases refer to the same entity, use the **most specific, informative version**.

---

### Step 2 − **Relation Extraction**  
Identify **meaningful semantic relations** between the extracted entities.  
- Relations must represent **logical reasoning**, **causal links**, **attribute assignments**, or **semantic connections**.  
- Use **concise, readable, natural relations** (e.g., "proves", "implies", "supports", "caused by", "part of", "indicates", "associated with", etc.).
- The goal is to **faithfully capture the reasoning flow** from the explanation.

---

### Step 3 − **Reasoning Alignment**  
Focus on triples that **directly reflect** how the explanation **supports or justifies** the answer.  
- You may **infer implicit reasoning steps** if they are obvious and strengthen the graph.  
- Omit irrelevant background facts that are not central to the reasoning.

---

### Formatting Instructions:
- Return the knowledge graph as a **Python list of triples**.
- Each triple must be a list of three strings: `["subject", "relation", "object"]`.
- No empty strings, no nulls, no broken triples.
- Avoid redundant triples. Prefer **informative, concise, complete triples**.
- Use simple quotation marks for all text.

---

## Final Reminders:
- Focus on extracting **reasoning chains** or **causal/semantic links** from the explanation.
- Coreference must be resolved to avoid duplication.
- Triples should **read naturally** and clearly show how the answer is justified.
- Keep the graph **compact, focused, and faithful** to the explanation.
